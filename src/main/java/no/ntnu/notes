TODO:
//further generalization of server and client class (combining each stage operation in both classes into 1 in the general class)
    -Symmetry in the task by server and answer by client to reduce code: when when task stage from client is valid
    set the boolean value for variable 'stage 1'in general class to true, if true then in server class trigger dispatch
    of task to client (stage 1)
    when dispatch of task in server is triggered, then set 'stage 2' boolean value to true in general class and perform
    stage 2 operations in both server and client... continue this way.
